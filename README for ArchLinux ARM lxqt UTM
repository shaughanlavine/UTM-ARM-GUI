THIS REQUIRES THAT YOUR IDEVICE BE JAILBROKEN.
It may, for all I know, be possible without that, but I don't have any knowledge or experience of how.


Unzip the file. It contains a .utm file. Add that to your UTM virtual machines.
You will need a terminal app that permits more then one tab to be open and a vnc app. The instructions here are tested on NewTerm and Screens. Those are not recommendations, just what I happen to use.

These instructions are for use with the default user, alarm. They will work, suitably modified, for any user *that is a member of the wheel group.* (The machine is set up so that members of the wheel group can sudo without authentication.)

Place the terminal and the vnc viewer in your dock. Set up the vnc viewer to connect to ip 127.0.0.1 and port 
5910 for linux with no authentication---note that the port is _not_ the default.

------------------------------------------------------
The instructions to start everything up follow.

Start the virtual machine.
Start the terminal as a "Slide Over" app.
Enter the command
    ssh -p 5555 alarm@127.0.0.1
Note. Sometimes UTM doesn't release the keyboard to the terminal. If that happens, just start a second terminal tab and switch to it and back.
You will be asked for the alarm password. Enter it. (The default password is "alarm".)
You are now logged in to the virtual machine. Enter the command
    startgui
There will be various error messages. Don't pay them any mind.
In a _new_ terminal tab,  enter the command
    ssh -f -N -T -L 5910:localhost:5900 alarm@127.0.0.1 -p 5555
Now slide the terminal window out of view, and launch your vnc viewer in split view. Launch it, configured as described above, and Bob's your uncle.

Enjoy!
